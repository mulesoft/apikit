The `<anypoint-styles>` component provides simple ways to use Anypoint CSS styles
in an application. The following imports are available:

1. [colors.html](https://github.com/advanced-rest-client/anypoint-styles/blob/master/colors.html):
a complete list of the colors defined in the Anypoint [palette](http://ux.mulesoft.com/#/colors)

2. [typography.html](https://github.com/advanced-rest-client/anypoint-styles/blob/master/typography.html):
Anypoint [font](http://ux.mulesoft.com/#/typography) styles and sizes

We recommend importing each of these individual files, and using the style mixins
available in each ones, rather than the aggregated `anypoint-styles.html` as a whole.
