A web components wrapper for the fetch polyfill from the https://github.com/github/fetch

Import it into the app and use the Fetch API

### Example
```
<link rel="import" href="bower_components/fetch-polyfill/fetch-polyfill.html">
```

After you import the element a `fetch` object in global namespace will be set.
The element is helpful if many web components require Fetch polyfill. When used
as an import it will be loaded only once.

Note that this code affects only those browsers that don't support fetch API.
At the moment Chrome and Firefox has native support.
