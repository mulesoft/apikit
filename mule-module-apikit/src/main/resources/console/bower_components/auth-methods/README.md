# auth-method-oauth2

The `<auth-method-oauth2>` element displays a form to provide the OAuth 2.0 settings.

### Example
```
<auth-method-oauth2></auth-method-oauth2>
```

This element uses `oauth2-scope-selector` so the `allowedScopes`, `preventCustomScopes` and
`scopes` properties will be set on this element. See documentation of `oauth2-scope-selector`
for more description.

### Forcing the user to select scope from the list
```
<auth-method-oauth2 prevent-custom-scopes></auth-method-oauth2>
```
```
var form = document.querySelector('auth-method-oauth2');
form.allowedScopes = ['profile', 'email'];
```

## Authorizing the user
The element sends the `oauth2-token-requested` with the OAuth settings provided with the form.
Any element / app can handle this event and perform authorization.

When the authorization is performed the app / other element should set back `tokenValue` property
of this element or send the `oauth2-token-response` with token response value so the change will
can reflected in the UI.
ARC provides the `oauth2-authorization` element that can handle this events.

### Example
```
<auth-method-oauth2></auth-method-oauth2>
<oauth2-authorization></oauth2-authorization>
```
The `oauth2-authorization` can be set anywhere in the DOM up from this element siblings to the
body. See demo for example usage.

## Redirect URL
Most OAuth 2 providers requires setting the redirect URL with the request. This can't be changed
by the user and redirect URL can be only set in the provider's settings panel. The element
accepts the `redirectUrl` property which will be displayed to the user that (s)he has to set up
this callback URL in the OAuth provider settings. It can be any URL where token / code will be
handled properly and the value returned to the `oauth2-authorization` element.
See `oauth2-authorization` documentation for more information.

If you going to use `oauth2-authorization` popup then the redirect URL value must be set to:
`/bower_components/oauth-authorization/oauth-popup.html`. Mind missing `2` in `oauth-authorization`.
This popup is a common popup for auth methods.

### Styling
`<auth-methods>` provides the following custom properties and mixins for styling:

Custom property | Description | Default
----------------|-------------|----------
`--auth-method-oauth2` | Mixin applied to the element. | `{}`

`--form-label` | Mixin applied to form labels. It will not affect `paper-*` labels | `{}`



### Events
| Name | Description | Params |
| --- | --- | --- |
| auth-settings-changed | Fired when the any of the auth method settings has changed. This event will be fired quite frequently - each time anything in the text field changed. With one exception. This event will not be fired if the validation of the form didn't passed.  This event will set current settings as a detail object which are the same as for the `oauth2-token-requested` event. Additionally it will contain a `tokenValue` property. This valye can be `undefined` if token hasn't been requested yet by the user. Clients should support a situaltion when the user do not request the token before requesting the resource and perform authorization. | settings **Object** - See the `oauth2-token-requested` for detailed description |
type **String** - The authentication type selected by the user. |
valid **Boolean** - True if the form has been validated. |
| oauth2-token-ready | Fired when the request token has been obtained and it's ready to serve. Because only one auth panel can be displayed ad a time it can be assumed that if new token has been obtained then it is current authorization method. | token **String** - The OAuth 2.0 token |
| oauth2-token-requested | Fired when user requested to perform an authorization. The details object vary depends on the `grantType` property. However this event always fire two properties set on the `detail` object: `type` and `clientId`. | type **String** - The type of grant option selected by the user. `implicit` is the browser flow where token ir requested. `authorization_code` or server flow is where client asks for the authorization code and exchange it later for the auth token using client secret. Other options are `password` and `client_credentials`. |
clientId **String** - Every type requires `clientId`. |
authorizationUrl **String** - Token authorization URL. Used in `implicit` and `authorization_code` types. In both cases means the initial endpoint to request for token or the authorization code. |
scopes **Array.<String>** - A list of scopes seleted by the user. Used in `implicit` and `authorization_code` types. |
redirectUrl **String** - A redirect URL of the client after authorization (or error). This must be set in the provider's OAuth settings. Callback URL must communicate with the app to pass the information back to the application. User can't change the `redirectUrl` but the app shouldn't rely on this value since in browser environment it is possible to temper with variables. The `redirectUrl` must be set to this element by owner app (which must know this value). A `redirectUrl` is set for `implicit` and `authorization_code` types. |
clientSecret **String** - The client secret that user can get from the OAuth provider settings console. User in `authorization_code` and `client_credentials` types. |
accessTokenUrl **String** - An URL to exchange code for the access token. Used by `authorization_code`, `client_credentials` and `password` types. |
username **String** - Used with `password` type. |
password **String** - Used with `password` type. |
