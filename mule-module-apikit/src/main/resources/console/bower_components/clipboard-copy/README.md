# clipboard-copy

An element that copies a text to clipboard.

### Example
```
<clipboard-copy content="test"></clipboard-copy>
```
```
var elm = document.querySelectior('clipboard-copy');
if(elm.copy()) {
  console.info('Content has been copied to the clipboard');
} else {
  console.error('Content copy error. This browser is ancient!');
}
```

### Styling
This element doesn't need styling because it's a logic element without the UI.



### Events
