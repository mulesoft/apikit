# arc-icons

A set of icons for Advanced REST Client.
This library exists to not import all material/iron icons to the app but only those are required.

Include library into the document / element:
```
<link rel="import" href="../arc-icons/arc-icons.html">
```

To use an icon from this set you mys prefix `iron-icon` with the `arc`, followed by a colon, ":", and then the icon id.

Example using the directions-bus icon from the maps icon set:
```
<iron-icon icon="arc:assignment"></iron-icon>
```
