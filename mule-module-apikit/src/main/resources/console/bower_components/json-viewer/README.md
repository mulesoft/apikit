# json-viewer

`<json-viewer>` A JSON payload viewer for the JSON response.

This element uses a web worker to process the JSON data.
To simplify our lives and app build process the worker script is embeded in the
imported template body. It will extract worker data from it and create the
worker. Otherwise build process would need to incude a worker script file
into set path which is not very programmer friendly.

### Example
```
<json-viewer json='{"json": "test"}'></json-viewer>
```

## Custom search
If the platform doesn't support native text search, this element implements
`ArcBehaviors.TextSearchBehavior` and exposes the `query` attribute.
Set any text to the `query` attribute and it will automatically highlight
occurance of the text.
See demo for example.

## Big numbers in JavaScript
This element marks all numbers that are above `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER` value
and locates the numeric value in source json if passed json was a string or
when `raw` attribute was set. In this case it will display a warning and
explanation about use of big numbers in JavaScript.
See js-max-number-error element documentation for more information.

## Content actions
The element can render a actions pane above the code view. Action pane is to
display content actions that is relevan in context of the response displayed
below the icon buttons. It should be icon buttons or just buttons added to this
view.

Buttons need to have `content-action` property set to be included to this view.

```
<json-viewer json='{"json": "test"}'>
  <paper-icon-button content-action title="Copy content to clipboard" icon="arc:content-copy"></paper-icon-button>
</json-viewer>
```
