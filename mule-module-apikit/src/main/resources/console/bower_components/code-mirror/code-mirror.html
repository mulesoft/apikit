## Code-Mirror
Polymer element wrapping [CodeMirror](http://codemirror.net)

### What is this?
Code-Mirror is a Web Component made with [Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org/) that wraps a default text-area with CodeMirror's highlight syntax, plugins and options.

### Installation and usage

`bower install --save advanced-rest-client/code-mirror`

### Example:

```html
...
<head>
    <link rel="import" href="bower_components/code-mirror/code-mirror.html"/>
</head>
<body>
  <code-mirror mode="javascript" theme="ambiance" line-numbers on-change="valueChanged">
      function myScript() {
        return 100;
      }
  </code-mirror>
</body>
```
The `<code-mirror>` element must be initialized with the `mode` property set. Otherwise it will initialize itself without any syntaxt highlighting, indent and autofill support.

### Accessing options
The element exposes the `setOption()` function that should be used to set editor options.

```
this.$.cm.setOption('extraKeys', {
  'Ctrl-Space': (cm) => {
    CodeMirror.showHint(cm, CodeMirror.hint['http-headers'], {
      container: Polymer.dom(this.root)
    });
  }
});
```

Additionaly the element has the `editor` property which is a refferene to CodeMirror instance.

### Rendering hidden element
CodeMirror has issues with rendering while the element is hidden. If the element is active
but not visible (e.g. in `<iron-pages>` element) then you may want to call `refresh()`
function on a CodeMirror instance after showing the element.

### Styling
`<code-mirror>` provides the following custom properties and mixins for styling:

Custom property | Description | Default
----------------|-------------|----------
`--code-mirror` | Mixin applied to the element | `{}`
`--code-mirror-wrapper` | Mixin applied to the wrapper element (where the CM is rendered) | `{}`
`--code-mirror-editor` | Mixin applied to the editor element  | `{}`
